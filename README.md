# Sacred Feminine

A modern web application built with Next.js, focusing on retreats, resources, and community engagement for Sacred Feminine - created in 2018 by Lisa Gungor and Dr. Hillary McBride. This site is created by brennan k.a. pollock

## üåü Overview

Sacred Feminine started as a series of retreats for woman-identifying people when Lisa and Hillary connected over the longing to create empowering and enlivening spaces with other women, and has now grown to include retreats for man-identifying people as well. The purpose of this work is to undo the burdens of patriarchal and colonial traditions, renegotiate the relationship with our bodies, redistribute the power in relationships, all while staying in touch with the play of life.
